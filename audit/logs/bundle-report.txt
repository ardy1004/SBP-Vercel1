BUNDLE ANALYSIS NOT POSSIBLE

Reason: Build process fails due to dependencies issues
Error: Cannot find package 'vite' - dependencies not properly installed

Recommendation:
1. Fix dependencies installation: rm -rf node_modules && npm install
2. Run build: npm run build
3. Use bundle analyzer: npx vite-bundle-analyzer dist

Expected bundle analysis would include:
- Top 10 assets by size
- Vendor chunks vs application code
- Compression ratios
- Tree-shaking effectiveness
- Image optimization impact
